## Installation and testing

Clone the project and serve it with [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install it globally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/notelho/av64x4.git
cd ./av64x4/
npm i -g http-server
http-server
```

Then go to http://localhost:8080/www/

## Usage

```javacript
import { AV64X4 } from './index.js'

let av64x4 = new AV64X4('mysupersecretkey')
let encoded = av64x4.encode('my super secret message') // av64x4 encoded hash
let decoded = av64x4.decode(encoded) // regular decoded string
let when = av64x4.when(encoded) // JS date object
```
### Key start

It is not necessary to pass the key in class constructor. Call the init() then pass it:

```javacript
import { AV64X4 } from './index.js'

let av64x4 = new AV64X4()
av64x4.init('mysupersecretkey')
```

### Key restart

You do not need to create a new object to sign a new key. Just use the init() function again:

```javacript
import { AV64X4 } from './index.js'

let av64x4 = new AV64X4()
av64x4.init('mysupersecretkey')
av64x4.init('anothersupersecretkey')
```
